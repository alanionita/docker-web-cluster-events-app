# UI

Main UI layer

## Stack

- Typescript
- NextJS
- react-hook-form

## Missing

- Lots....
- Proper designs as what I did here https://www.figma.com/design/viT63nxzS1fa6WkQGlbdWN/events-designs-alan-ionita?node-id=0-1&t=MBrvTvJn5mMDuc9z-1
- Accessibility
- Animation
- Styling
- E2E tests
- Cypress tests

## Future

- Build the designs
- Styling:
    - Likely use css modules as they are here
    - Plus add components from MUI or Shadcn where needed 
    - Horizontal scroller I'd do in plain css because of accessibility
- Some motion and parallax would've been nice
